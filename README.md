For the Register Product application, let the customer skip the Customer Login page if they have already logged in. (Required reading: chapters 1-6 and 12) 

The Register Product page 

 

Operation 

    Same as project 6-4, but a customer who has logged in can skip the Customer Login page. 

    The customer can view the message on the Register Product page to verify that they are logged in. 

    To log out, the customer can click on the Logout button or close the browser. If the user clicks the Logout button, the Customer Login page is displayed. 

Specifications 

    Use a session cookie for the session. That way, the session ends when the user closes the browser. 

    Store the customer data in the session. That way, you donâ€™t have to use hidden fields to pass the customer ID to the controller.
